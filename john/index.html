    <h1>John Speelman</h1>

    <p>
      John Speelman was a craftsman, builder, and the father of David Speelman. His most iconic project — a model Spanish galleon — was 
      constructed over many years, beginning in the early 1960s and completed in 1979. It stands as a testament to his creativity, persistence, and skill.
    </p>

    <p>
      While we don't have an interview with John himself, his son David shares the story of the galleon and reflects on John's life and influence 
      in a recorded conversation.
