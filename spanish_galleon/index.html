    <h1>Spanish Galleon Model</h1>

    <p>
      This model Spanish galleon was built by John Speelman, father of David Speelman. As a young man, John came across an advertisement in <em>Popular Mechanics</em> that captured his imagination. Years later, beginning in the early 1960s and completing it in 1979, he brought the ship to life through painstaking craftsmanship. The model has since become a cherished piece of family history.

      In an interview with <a href="../david/">David Speelman</a> recorded on July 5, 2025, David shares the story of the galleon and reflects on his father’s dedication to the project. The conversation also moves beyond the model itself, touching on David's own life, his relationship with his wife Cathy, and a broader portrait of John as both a builder and a father.

      While we can't say for certain this exact ad was the original source, the image is unmistakable. It’s likely that the plans came from this <em>Popular Mechanics</em> issue.
